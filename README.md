# Odoo landing page test

# A fully functional responsive landing page written in HTML, SCSS and JS. Written by Luis Alejandro Lopez de Anda.

This project is an example of a fully functional responsive landing page. It means it can be viewed in mobile, tablet and desktop platforms.

The project only uses CSS grid and Flexbox to make it fully responsive.
There was no need to add external libraries to address simplicity and performance.

All SCSS files are separated into modules to find the one you want to work with. Each module corresponds to each section of the landing page.

Some areas of improvement include:

1.  The possibility to make it more attractive, by using floating shapes,
2.  Bigger titles and color contrast
3.  We could also play with on scroll animations.

Always caring for neat and clean design.
